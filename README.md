# Water Intake Tracker

## Overview
The **Water Intake Tracker** is a Java-based application designed to help users track and manage their daily water consumption. It provides personalized water intake goals, logs daily water intake, sends reminders to drink water, and allows users to monitor their hydration progress over time. The app uses MySQL as the database to store user data and track historical intake records.

## Features
- **Daily Water Goal**: Set personalized daily water intake targets based on user preferences or recommended guidelines.
- **Water Log**: Record the amount of water consumed throughout the day and visualize progress toward the daily goal.
- **Reminders**: Get reminders to drink water at scheduled intervals to stay hydrated.
- **History**: View and analyze historical water intake data over time.
- **Data Export**: Export consumption data in a readable format (e.g., CSV) for further analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java (developed using NetBeans IDE)
- **Database**: MySQL for storing user data and hydration logs
- **Frontend**: (Optional, if any GUI is involved, e.g., JavaFX or other)

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can:
1. Set your daily water intake goal.
2. Log your water consumption as you drink.
3. View progress towards your hydration goal.
4. Set reminders to help you stay on track with your water intake.
